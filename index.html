            Savitribai was born on January 3, 1831, in Naigaon (presently in Satara district) in British 
            India in a farming family to Khandoji Neveshe Patil and Lakshmi as their eldest daughter. Girls in those days were married off early, 
            so following the prevalent customs,the nine year old Savitribai was wedded to 12 years old Jyotirao Phule in 1840. 
            Jyotirao went on to become a thinker, writer, social activist and anti-caste social reformer. 
            He is counted among the leading figures of Maharashtra's social reform movement. Savitribai's education started after her marriage.
            It was her husband who taught her to read and write after he saw her eagerness to learn and educate herself. 
            She cleared third and fourth year examination from a normal school and became passionate about teaching. 
            She took training at Ms Farar's Institution in Ahmednagar. Jyotirao stood firmly by the side of Savitribai in all her social endeavours.
